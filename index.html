        <h1>About me</h1><br>
        <p>Hello, my name is Benjamin. Born and raised in Philadelphia. Recent graduate at Community College of
            Philadelphia under
            Associate of Art major in Culture, Science, and technology. A friend introduces me into coding and now
            attending the
            University Of Pennsylvania coding boot camp to get experiences and learn new skills. I love to read,
            travel, and do
            outdoors things. My guilty please is watching anime, binge on any shows online, and gym. YouTube, reddit,
            and Medium
            the three most three things I visit daily. Because youtube has ton of information you get, reddit and
            Medium are
            sources where I can get my knowledge and people experience.</p>
        <p>The one thing I can live without is bean spout because the
            taste makes me gag never like it when I was a child. Itâ€™s a pleasure to meet you all, and hopefully to meet
            you in person.</p>
